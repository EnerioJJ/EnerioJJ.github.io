Don't ask me how, but I misspelled the word "decided" and didn't catch it until it was too late. That should ensure the level of quality you're about to get. But in any case:

My story isn't a particularly interesting one nor is it especially glamourous.

The only reason I want to learn software engineering is to do something new and different. I've always wanted to create computer and mobile apps that could be helpful through the day-to-day. I want to see if I can turn those thoughts into something quasi-tangible or at least interest. Software engineering opens the potential for many real world applications (pardon the pun), and I want to see where this could go. In a sense, this is a completely different world to what I'm used to. And so, I have to follow that path.

Me being here is mostly just to see if I can cut the mustard, so to say.
